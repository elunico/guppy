# Things to do
- [ ] Add option for -c HEAD to retrieve the most recent commit
- [ ] Add ability to get information using USER mode including list of repos
- [ ] Add mypy typing? (maybe)
- [ ] Change Multiple{Issue,Commit}DisplayObject to only print titles/shas and dates and not the full description/message of the issue/commit. Single{Issue,Commit}DisplayObject should still print all information
